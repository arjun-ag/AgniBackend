        "poem": "These times, so full of gasps for nothing done,\\n Hide truth behind the sound of rain that roars {'\\n'}Above a peak hour rush. These streets, once drenched \\n And quiet, have no-one left to stop and hear. \\n\\n But I have walked the night and braved the storm \\n To find desertion midst these city lights. \\n So I have heard the voice of God entrapped \\n Beneath one wayward honk in search of home.",
